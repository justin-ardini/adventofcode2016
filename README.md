# adventofcode2016

ðŸŽ„ Rust solutions to Advent of Code 2016, with minimal use of external libraries. ðŸŽ„

These were completed as a basic Rust learning exercise, so don't expect idiomatic Rust.

## How to run

Run with `cargo`, solutions are printed to console.

`cargo run --bin=dayXX`

## Thanks
